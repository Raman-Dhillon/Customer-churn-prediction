# Customer Churn Prediction Using PyCaret + Streamlit + Machine Learning

Predict whether a telecom customer will churn using an automated machine learning pipeline powered by PyCaret.

## 📘 Project Overview

Customer churn prediction helps telecom companies identify customers who are likely to disconnect services.

This project uses:

1. PyCaret (Classification Module) for AutoML

2. Streamlit for interactive UI

3. Telco Customer Churn dataset

4. Final Model Saved as churn_model.pkl

The goal is to automate:

✔ Data preprocessing

✔ Best model selection

✔ Hyperparameter tuning

✔ Ensemble methods

✔ Confusion matrix & AUC visualization

✔ Model export for deployment

## 📊 Dataset

Telco Customer Churn Dataset
Filename: **WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv**

It includes:

1. Customer demographics

2. Service subscriptions

3. Contract/payment details

4. Monthly & total charges

5. Churn label (Yes/No)

## 🧠 Machine Learning Pipeline

This project performs:

✔ 1. Setup (PyCaret environment)

✔ 2. Compare models (AutoML)

✔ 3. Create & Tune best model

✔ 5. Confusion Matrix & AUC plots

✔ 6. Final model saved as churn_model.pkl
